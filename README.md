drop-chart
==========

jQuery/d3 plugin which allows simple d3 charts to be dropped into pages using only tags and 'data-' elements. It was
built by Travis Griffiths in Coffeescript. Documentation available at:

https://github.com/TravisGriffiths/drop-chart/wiki

NOTE: This is pre-Alpha work!! Currently getting all the backend code working and using a simple pie chart as the only
working front end. Once all selectors and event triggers are tested and passing I will be adding line and bar graphs.
Additional functionality will follow as time allows and demand dictates.
